In this game you are a gladiator in your team of computer gladiators. They fight automatically and you fight on their side. The team leadership issues you equipment and spells and also own money which can be used to buy more equipment or go to a bar with the computer gladiators from your team or others'. The more they are friends the less they attack you on the field or in the case that they are in your team they get a morale boost. You are a good fighter so sometimes leadership asks for your help. Or just be a laid-back dark elf frost mage behind the lines and enjoy the automatic fights. You can also use the extra money to do big special attacks.
